## 📌 Project Overview

Pneumonia is a serious respiratory infection that requires early and accurate diagnosis. Traditional deep learning models perform well but require large datasets and high computational resources.

This project proposes a **Hybrid Quantum–Classical approach**:
- Classical CNN → Efficient feature extraction  
- Quantum CNN (8-Qubit QCNN) → Advanced feature learning  
- Dense classifier → Final prediction  

The model demonstrates how **quantum computing principles like superposition and entanglement** can enhance medical image classification.
